# BASKETBALL-SCORE-COUNTER
It's a simple basketball score counter app, build using HTML, css and javaScript


there is two columns first for HOME team second for GUEST team, and a scoreboard along with each team where score will be reflacted. also there is three buttons for adding new score to the team (+1,+2,+3) respectively.

if we have to add scores for new game then we can simply click on NEW GAME button this will reset all the values added before on scoreboard.

also some UI experiments i have added for example:  
  1) when we click or hover on a score adding button button will be highlighted.
  2) which team will be leading in score means which one have have more score that team name will be shown with extra text effect.
  3) if we hover on NEW GAME button, we can observe front transition in another style.
